## Introduction
Invisible Code JS is a security-focused proof of concept that allows JavaScript code to be hidden using zero-width Unicode characters. By encoding code into an invisible format, it becomes undetectable to the naked eye while remaining fully functional when executed.

## Function
### Process
1. The code is designed to accept Unicode characters as input;
2. The input is converted into an 8-bit string;
3. The 8-bit string is transformed into a binary string;
4. The binary string (ones and zeros) is mapped as follows:
   - **0 (zero)**: U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
   - **1 (one)**: U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER
5. This forms the invisible code.

### Features
A few files can be found in the [`/src`](/src) folder:
- **[`build.js`](/src/build.js)**: Encodes the code string to invisible code and returns a script that decodes the invisible code and runs it;
- **[`decode.js`](/src/decode.js)**: Decodes the invisible code to a code string;
- **[`encode.js`](/src/encode.js)**: Encodes the code string to invisible code.

## Usage
### Build
üì• **Input**: String containing invisible code.  
üì§ **Output**: String containing JavaScript code that decodes and runs the invisible code.
1. Copy the code from **[`build.js`](/src/build.js)**;
2. Assign JavaScript code as a string to the first variable;
3. Run the code.

### Encode
üì• **Input**: String containing JavaScript code.  
üì§ **Output**: String containing invisible code, enclosed in single quotes.
1. Copy the code from **[`encode.js`](/src/encode.js)**;
2. Assign JavaScript code as a string value to the first variable;
3. Run the code.

> [!TIP]
> Copy the script's output (invisible code enclosed in single quotes) and use as input for the [decode](#decode) script.

### Decode
üì• **Input**: String containing invisible code.  
üì§ **Output**: String containing the original encoded JavaScript code.
1. Copy the code from **[`decode.js`](/src/decode.js)**;
2. Replace the value of the first variable, with the output from the [encode](#encode) script;
3. Run the code.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you don't miss any invisible code when copying by copying the full output from the [encode](#encode) script, including the single quotes. Then, replace the single quotes defining the first variable value in the decode script.
