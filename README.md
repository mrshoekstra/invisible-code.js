## Function
How does it work?
1. The code is designed to accept Unicode characters as input;
2. The input is converted into an 8-bit string;
3. The 8-bit string is transformed into a binary string;
4. The binary string (ones and zeros) is mapped as follows:
   - **0 (zero)**: U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
   - **1 (one)**: U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER
5. This forms the invisible code.

## Usage
### Build
1. Copy the code from **[`encode-build.js`](/src/encode-build.js)**;
2. Enter JavaScript code between the single quotes of the `input` variable;\
```const input = 'üî¥';```
3. Run the code inside a console window;
4. Copy the `console.log()` response;
5. This is the script that runs your hidden code.

### Encode
1. Copy the code from **[`encode.js`](/src/encode.js)**;
2. Enter JavaScript code between the single quotes of the `input` variable;\
```const input = 'üî¥';```
3. Run the code inside a console window;
4. Copy the `console.log()` response for the decode script, including the single quotes.

### Decode
1. Copy the code from **[`decode-append.js`](/src/decode-append.js)** or **[`decode-eval.js`](/src/decode-eval.js)**;
2. Replace the value of the `a` variable, including the single quotes, with the response from the [encode](#encode) script;\
```a='üî¥';```
3. Run the code.

## Features
A few examples can be found in the [`/src`](/src) folder:
- **[`decode-append.js`](/src/decode-append.js)**: Decodes the invisible code and appends it to the DOM;
- **[`decode-eval.js`](/src/decode-eval.js)**: Decodes the invisible code and evaluates/executes it after decoding;
- **[`encode.js`](/src/encode.js)**: Encodes the string in the `input` variable and outputs the result using `console.log()`;
- **[`encode-build.js`](/src/encode-build.js)**: Encodes the string in the `input` variable and returns the decode script that includes the encoded text, outputting it using `console.log()`.
